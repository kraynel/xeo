# Welcome to Xeo

Xeo is a graph based platform which organises pages in the same way our brains do - rather than storing data in a hierarchy of objects, Xeo stores data in a graph.

Xeo also works to serve as an open source alternative to [Trello](https://trello.com), [Notion](https://notion.so), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
